The VR app created for this project is a Solar System Exploration app. Through this app, the user
gets an opportunity to learn different facts about our first 4 planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
and the Sun. This app provides users with a truly immersive experience, allowing them to absorb
intriguing facts about each planet. Users can also navigate through the cosmos with the
teleportation feature, offering a closer, more detailed look at the planets. To give a real-time
experience, planets can be seen revolving around the Sun in different orbits at varying speed.
